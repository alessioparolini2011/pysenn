A Python package, based on PyTorch, to build self-expanding Neural Networks and train them with an optimized process.

I'm building it because **I want to make SENN easier to create and manage**. I'm starting from scratches, for create a really efficient and optimized structure.

### ExpLayer (SELL):

**The core layer**  
It is the core of the package: is built starting from a nn.Module (avoiding the nn.Linear limits) to have **a full-customizable structure**.
So I've built a linear layer that can expand his structure, adding new neurons and **improving automatically the neural network power**.
### FilterLayer:

**The bridge**  
A static layer would break if the previous layer grows from 8 to 12 neurons. 
So I've built **FilterLayer**, a layer that takes the variable output of a SELL and **return always the same sizes Tensor**, keeping the flow stable.

### ExpModule:

**The container**   
Groups one ExpLayer + one FilterLayer (putting a ReLU between them) inside a nn.ModuleList. **So you can implement SELL in your nn much easier, because you can use it like a normal layer, it handles everything automatically for you**



## Quickstart

**You need Python 3.12 on your machine**

To install the package, run:

```bash
pip install pysenn
```

As I showed before, you can use a ExpModule to implement a SELL in your nn:

```python
import torch
from pysenn.sell import ExpModule

x = torch.randn(8, 10)

module = ExpModule(in_features=10,
                   out_features=22)  # use it like a normal layer, the features inside manage everything for you

x = module(x) # use it like a normal module

print(x.size()) # out: 8, 22

module.expand(4) # add 4 neurons

x = module(x)  

print(x.size()) # out: 8, 26
```

>[!WARNING]
>Because of the self-expanding structure, for now **the package doesn't work with optimizers** (optimizers like ADAM have a gradients memory that crashes if you add new). The only way is **using SGD optimizer and recreating it every time you expand the neural network**. See below.

Here's how you should do to use an SGD optimizer:

```python

from torch import nn

from torch import optim

from pysenn.sell import ExpModule


class MyModule(nn.Module):
    
    def __init__(self):
        
        super().__init__()
        
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(in_features=1, out_features=5)
        
        self.sell = ExpModule(in_features=5, out_features=10)
        
        self.layer3 = nn.Linear(in_features=10, out_features=1)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        
        x = self.layer1(x)
        
        x = self.relu(x)
        
        x = self.sell(x)
        
        x = self.relu(x)
        
        x = self.layer3(x)
        
        return x
    
model = MyModule()

senn = ExpModule(in_features=5, out_features=10)

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)  # model is a fake nn.Module with static and self-expanding layers

... # training process

senn.expand(4)  # expand

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)  # CREATE A NEW OPTIMIZER!

```

**Built with:**
- PyTorch - for all tensor operations, autograd and nn.Module base
- Hack Club - for the Terra program, feedback and the Week 1 ship motivation

Without PyTorch this project would not be possible. Thanks to Hack Club for supporting student-built open source.
